 * A TypeScript replay of capability-spike/pkl/Ledger.pkl's checkAccess() --

 * `grantsByFactId` is Ledger.pkl's real supervisor state
 * (`GrantState.pkl`'s `Mapping<String, Grant>`, generated to TypeScript as
 * `grant_state.pkl.ts`'s `Grant`), keyed by factID exactly as
 * `GrantState.approvedGrants` is.
 *
 * This function has no access to a Pkl evaluator; it is validated instead
 * by capabilityAcquisition.spec.ts, which checks its CAP_REJECTED verdict
 * against the same (factID, vault) pair `worker/area51_site4.pkl` records
 * a real `pkl test` failure for, and its passing (null) verdict against
 * the pair `worker/flight_booking_area51.pkl` records a real `pkl test`
 * pass for.
